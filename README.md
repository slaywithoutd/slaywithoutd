# Welcome ! 

- I'm **Maria Clara**, aka **SlayWithoutD**, a **Computer Science** student at **Inteli**, navigating the vast landscapes of technology. I'm here to code, create, and collaborate, building something awesome with every line of code. <br />
  -   DFTBA!

### 🏹 A Little About Me
- 🌌 Playing Minecraft, and specially messing around with Redstone it's what sparked my interest in coding;
  > "What's the point of logic if it doesn't make your life better in any way".
- ♟️ I love playing chess since my childhood! Although I'm more passionate that skilled;
  > "Chess is a lot like life. You start out with a plan, and then everything falls apart".
- 🛠 My goal it's to make a difference in Brazil's education system through technology;
  > "Stay in school, kids. It makes you better at pvp".
