### Notes:  
1. **Chess Game**: Update the chess board as moves are made (requires manual editing for now).  
2. **Customization**: Replace the placeholders (e.g., email, Twitter) with real links or delete sections you don't want.  
3. Let me know if you want to add any other sections, like your projects or goals!
