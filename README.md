  I'm <b>Maria Clara</b>, aka <b>SlayWithoutD</b>, a <b>18yo</b> <b>Computer Science</b> student at <b>Inteli</b>, navigating the vast landscapes of technology.

## 👩🏻‍💻 A few facts about me — DFTBA
- 🌌 Playing Minecraft, and specially messing around with Redstone it's what sparked my interest in coding. Around age 10, I joined a robotics course that taught coding basics through games, where I also learned to work with Arduinos;
  > "What's the point of logic if it doesn't make your life better in any way."
  
- ♟️ I've loved playing chess since childhood. While more passionate than skilled, I've participated in several tournaments over the years, winning a couple of trophies and medals;
  > "Chess is a lot like life. You start out with a plan, and then everything falls apart."

- 🛠 With my robotics background, I co-founded the first robotics club at my high school, where I taught students and helped us grow to the point of competing and showcasing projects at other schools. Our success led the principal to select me and a few peers to develop the official school website, earning us medals and citywide recognition;
  > "The trick to education is to teach people in such a way that they don't realize they're learning until it's too late."

- 🎓 My goal is to make a difference in Brazil's education system through technology. I'm currently involved with Instituto Ponte, an educational NGO that supports kids in overcoming socioeconomic challenges to excel academically;
  > "Stay in school, kids. It makes you better at pvp."

- 🎼 Besides my passion for technology, I'm an art enthusiast. I've spent nearly half my life in dance classes, love everything music-related, and can play a few instruments. I'm also a literature fan, always exploring new stories and ideas;
  > "Technology alone is not enough. It’s technology married with liberal arts, married with the humanities, that yields us the results that make our hearts sing."

- ✈️ I'm fluent in Portuguese (native language) and English (self-taught). One one my dreams is to to learn many different languages and I'm currently exploring German and LIBRAS, inspired by my friends who speak these languages.
  > "But if thought corrupts language,  language can also corrupt thought."
  
## 🕯 "Fascinated by words; drawn to a particular *Verb*"
A fun fact about me is that I'm a "quote collector." Whether scribbled in the margins of my notebooks, saved in a dedicated folder, or noted from passing conversations, any quote that grabs my attention finds its way into my collection. These quotes range from the wisdom of great minds and song lyrics to silly things friends say. I treasure them all and enjoy referencing them in random situations — they add a unique flavor to my personality.


## 🤟 The friends we made along the way:
