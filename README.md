## 🏹 A Little About Me
- 🌌 Playing Minecraft, and specially messing around with Redstone it's what sparked my interest in coding;
  > "What's the point of logic if it doesn't make your life better in any way".
- ♟️ I love playing chess since my childhood! Although I'm more passionate that skilled;
  > "Chess is a lot like life. You start out with a plan, and then everything falls apart".
